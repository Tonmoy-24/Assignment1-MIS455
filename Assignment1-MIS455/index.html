                <h2>About Me </h2>
                <p>This is Tonmoy Baishnob. i'm doing BSc in CSE at IUB. And my minor is MIS.
                     I have rich experience in web site design, building and customization.
                     I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience.
                      I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. 
                      I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; 
                      I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean.
                       I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot
                        sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. 
                        I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. <br> </br>
                        I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, 
                        I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. 
                        I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.
